🎵 Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation – EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify songs to understand and segment music genres based on audio features. Built using Google Colab, it focuses on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within musical attributes.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains Spotify tracks with features such as:

Danceability

Energy

Tempo

Loudness

Valence

Acousticness

Genre labels

🔍 Objectives

Analyze distribution of audio features

Compare genres using statistical and visual methods

Identify patterns that distinguish music genres

Prepare insights useful for recommendation systems or ML models

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Google Colab

📈 Key Insights
